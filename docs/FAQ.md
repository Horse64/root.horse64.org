Can I use Horse64 Root on embedded hardware?
--------------------------------------------

Horse64 Root needs at least a 32bit CPU with support for
64bit integer math support in hardware, and some modules
depend on pre-emptive hardware threading provided by some
operating system layer. Therefore, it may not be the most
suited for embedded use right now.
