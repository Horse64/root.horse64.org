Moose64 Programming Language
============================

The [**Moose64**](https://m64.horse64.org) language is like C
but with pretty Horse64 syntax and basic object-oriented
programming. It's made for maintainable high-performance
code. Its uses are:

- Simpler than C++, but still has competent
  object-oriented programming (OOP),

- Borrows its syntax and approachable look from [Horse64](
  https://horse64.org/),

- Great C inter-operability.

- [See more...](/docs/Features.md)

**Currently unusable, stay tuned.**


### Useful starting points

- [Read introduction](/docs/Introduction.md).

- [Check project news](https://horse64.org/#news).

- [Project license](LICENSE.md).

This repository holds the code of the m64 stdlib, which is the m64 standard
library, and its main documentation. The code is officially hosted on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/m64.horse64.org) with a GitHub
mirror. The code of the moosec compiler is part of the `core.horse64.org`
package instead.


Install & Build
---------------

The recommended way to install is [to get the prebuilt Horse64 SDK](
https://horse64.org/get) which includes [the moosec compiler for Moose64](
/docs/Compilation.md).


Where Is What?
--------------

If you want to contribute or report a bug, you'll find
the Horse64 and Moose64 ecosystem is made of a larger
bunch of projects. Due to that, **locating where each
component is** and where the code is, can occasionally
be challenging. Therefore, there's a
[handy resource list for finding projects and
code locations](
https://horse64.org/docs/Resources) to help you out.
